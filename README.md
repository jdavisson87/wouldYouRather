This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Would You Rather...

This is the application where you, as a user, will create, view and answer polls to
decide what you and other users would rather do.  

## Installation

Be sure to download or clone the repo from

https://github.com/jdavisson87/wouldYouRather

Once the file has been downloaded, go into your terminal and run

npm install

Once the packages have been installed, run

npm start

## Using the application

Once the application has been started, log into one of the users on the login
screen.  Once you are logged in, you will start at the homepage, which will show
all of the unanswered polls for your current user.  You can click the selector
to choose whether you want to view the unanswered polls or the answered polls.

If you click on any poll, it will take you to the poll details page.  If you
haven't answered the poll, you will be prompted to make a decision before you
see the results of the poll.  If you have answered the poll, you will see how
many people have selected each option, and your avatar will show which option
you have selected.  

If you click on the Add Question link, you will be taken to a new page where
there will be 2 text input fields and a submit button.  Put in your options into
each text field, and once you submit your poll, you will be taken back to the
Dashboard page and your unanswered poll will be the first poll on the list.  
Click the poll and answer, and soon, other users will answer your poll as well.

Finally, the last page is the Leaderboard page.  On this page, you will see
which users have answered and asked the most questions.
